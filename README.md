# Baltimore City Employee Salary Cluster Analysis
  There have been numerous reports of scandals involving the salaries in various departments of Baltimore city's payroll.  From the police department where in 2018 they spent more than 3 times their overtime budget to the school district where principal's at underprivileged schools reportedly made six figures,  there have been numerous examples of certain employees and departments being overpaid.  With this knowledge I wanted to perform a cluster analysis on all 650+ city departments to find groupings of departments based upon annual salary, gross salary, and tenure based off of the Baltimore fiscal year 2019.  My goal was to see if there are clusters of departments that are overpaid, paid adequately, or underpaid.
